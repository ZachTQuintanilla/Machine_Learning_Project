# Machine_Learning_Project
Final Project for Machine Learning Course at The University of Texas under the instruction of Dr. Pyrcz.

## Summary
This project applied Principle Component analysis to a data set to obtain 3 features which could be easily visualized, from 6 total features. Polynomial regression and support vector machines were then used to model and predict the response feature. Overall, the polynomial regression model proved to be the more successful model for this particular data set.
